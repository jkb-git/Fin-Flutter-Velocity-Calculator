# Fin-Flutter-Velocity-Calculator
Calculates the velocity at which rocket fins are likely to experience "flutter," the velocity beyond which catastrophic fin failure is probable due to aerodynamically induced undampened fin oscillation.
Read the accompanying article "Calculating_Fin_Flutter_Velocity_Bennett-12-23" for guidance on how to use this spreadsheet.
