# Fin-Flutter-Velocity-Calculator
Calculates the velocity at which rocket fins are likely to experience "flutter," the velocity beyond
which catastrophic fin failure is probable due to aerodynamically induced undampened fin oscillation.
Read the accompanying article "Calculating_Fin_Flutter_Velocity_Bennett-12-23" for guidance on how to
use this spreadsheet. The companion article "Calculating_Fin_Flutter_Velocity_For_Complex_Fin_Shapes"
describes how to apply these techniques to fin shapes other than trapezoids or ellipses.
